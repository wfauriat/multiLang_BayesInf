## Bayesian Inference -- Full-stack web App

- Bayesian Inference core (core in **Python**, and some small attemps in C++ (not yet implemented because the gain w/r to numpy/python is not significant)),
    - In the style of **probabilistic programming paradigm**, i.e. with objects for random variables (observed or priors)
- Flask (**Python**) Back-end
- React (**Javascrit**) Front-end

> Run using the script "*run_local_server.sh*" with a python virtual env that includes *gunicorn* (see requirements.txt)
> And open front-end (and API server) at endpoint http://127.0.0.1:5000

Also, hosted on Render @ https://bi-webapp.onrender.com/

## Bayesian Inference -- Desktop App

(also enclosed in the repository)

- Same **Python** Core (as above)
- GUI in PyQt5

> Run "python Qt_App.py" (in a virtual env that includes PyQt5 : not in requirement.txt, must be added)

#### *Developped from mid to end 2025 (W. Fauriat)*
