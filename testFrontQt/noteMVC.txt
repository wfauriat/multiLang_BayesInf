PyQt VS React

Feature	            PyQt MVC (Python/Desktop)	                        React MVC (JavaScript/Web)
Primary Goal    	Performance & Native Experience	                    Portability & Universal Access
Concurrency	        True Multi-Threading (QThread)	                    Single-Threaded Asynchronicity (async/await)
Speed (CPU-Bound)	Faster (runs on separate CPU cores)	                Slower (shares a single CPU thread)
Complexity	        High (Managing thread safety is difficult)	        Low (Managing async flow is simpler)
Architecture	    Strict separation of classes	                    View and Controller often merged via Hooks
Best For	        Internal tools, data processing, heavy computation	Customer-facing apps, mobile/desktop reach, rapid development


Category	    PyQt
Primary Output	Executable files (.exe, .app) that run locally on a user's machine.
Technology	    Python programming language + the robust Qt C++ framework.
Deployment	    Requires packaging tools (like PyInstaller) to bundle Python and Qt libraries.
Core Skills	    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python, understanding desktop layouts, event loops, signals/slots, and system integration.
Best For	    Internal tools, scientific modeling/data analysis applications (like the one we built), complex utilities, offline-first software, and hardware interaction.
Pros	        Performance (backed by C++ Qt), deep system access, no reliance on web browsers, strong tooling for complex native UI.
Cons	        Less relevant for web-first companies, more complex deployment process, not natively cross-platform for mobile/web (though Qt has modules, PyQt is less used here).

Category	    React
Primary Output	Browser-rendered HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Technology	    JavaScript/TypeScript programming language + modern browser APIs.
Deployment	    Hosted on a web server, accessible via URL.
Core Skills	    JavaScript/TypeScript, Functional Programming, State Management (Hooks, Redux), API interaction (REST, GraphQL), HTML/CSS.
Best For	    E-commerce sites, social media feeds, SaaS platforms, corporate dashboards, and high-interaction web interfaces.
Pros	        Massive Job Market, runs everywhere a browser is, instantaneous updates, excellent ecosystem for scaling web apps.
Cons	        Requires a server/browser to run, slower performance for purely local/CPU-intensive tasks, security reliance on web standards.
